# ActioNet
## Task-Based Dataset
Our dataset can be found in the './dataset/{collection_id}' folders.

Each data file has the naming convention of '{task}\_{floor_plan}'

In each data file, there are two lists. The first list shows the task and the floor plan. The second list shows the series of actions taken to complete the task.

The './dataset/resources/task_descriptions' folder contains the task descriptions of the tasks for each collection instance.

The './dataset/resources/user_tasks' folder contains the collection instances and tasks that each user is in charge of.
